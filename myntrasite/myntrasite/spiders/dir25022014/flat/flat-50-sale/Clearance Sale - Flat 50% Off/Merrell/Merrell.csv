Designed specifically for women, the Pace Glove is a barefoot trail running shoe with a lightweight, glove-like fit and zero-drop heel, allowing you to run the way you were meant to. These women's barefoot shoes have a little extra protection in the toe and sides to help you avoid injuries from rocks and roots and an ultra-lightweight upper with a synthetic leather foot sling for stability. Plus, the wide toe box lets your toes splay naturally, and the Vibram soles provide traction over even the slipperiest trails.</p></li><li class="desc-sub-title ">Product Details</li><li class="desc-sub-text"><p>Round toed, grey sports shoes with purple accents, low tops with central lace-ups<br/>Microfiber and breathable air mesh upper<br/>Merrell Omni-Fit lacing system secured with welded TPU provides a precise, glove-like fit<br/>Synthetic leather rear foot sling provides stability<br/>Internal support construction secures the midfoot for optimal fit and support<br/>Non-removable microfiber footbed treated with Aegis<br/>1mm forefoot shock absorption plate maintains forefoot flexibility and protects the foot by<br/>distributing pressure<br/>Vibram Trail Glove and TC1 rubber outsole with patterned grooves and lugs for traction<br/>Approximate weight: 139 gm<br/>Warranty: 180 days against manufacturing defects only<br/><img src="http://myntra.myntassets.com/images/banners/march2013/1363957727-Aegis-small.jpg"/><br/>Aegis Microbe Shield: While some antimicrobial treatments block odour, Aegis takes a more aggressive approach, with an onslaught of polymer spikes that rupture the cell walls of odourproducing microbes that stops odour in its tracks.

First, no company does a better job of creating lug patterns that provide stability in all conditions, with no lugs placed under the arch, so your foot flexes more naturally for greater comfort. Second, they've created two advanced rubber compounds - Trek and TC5+ - that provide sure traction on both wet and dry surfaces in even the most extreme temperatures.<br/><img src="http://myntra.myntassets.com/images/banners/march2013/1363954092-0mm-drop-small.jpg"/><br/>Barefoot running shoe.<br/><img src="http://myntra.myntassets.com/images/banners/march2013/1363956884-8mm-cush-small.jpg"/><br/>Merrell's patented midsole offers the best of both worlds- the cushioning you need for all-day comfort and the control you need for support in all kinds of terrain.
