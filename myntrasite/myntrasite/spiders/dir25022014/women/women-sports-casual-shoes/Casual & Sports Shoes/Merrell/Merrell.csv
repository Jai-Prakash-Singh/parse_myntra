Second, they've created two advanced rubber compounds - Trek and TC5+ - that provide sure traction on both wet and dry surfaces in even the most extreme temperatures.</p></li><li class="desc-sub-title ">Material &amp; Care</li><li class="desc-sub-text "><p>Synthetic, rubber<br/>Hand wash in cold water, gentle detergent and air dry</p></li></ul>,26:02:2014,None
