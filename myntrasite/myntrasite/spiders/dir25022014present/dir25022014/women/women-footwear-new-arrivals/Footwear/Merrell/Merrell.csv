First, no company does a better job of creating lug patterns that provide stability in all conditions, with no lugs placed under the arch, so your foot flexes more naturally for greater comfort. Second, they've created two advanced rubber compounds - Trek and TC5+ - that provide sure traction on both wet and dry surfaces in even the most extreme temperatures.<br/><img alt="" src="http://myntra.myntassets.com/images/banners/march2013/1363954092-0mm-drop-small.jpg"/><br/>Barefoot running shoe.<br/><img alt="" src="http://myntra.myntassets.com/images/banners/march2013/1363956884-8mm-cush-small.jpg"/><br/>Merrell's patented midsole offers the best of both worlds- the cushioning you need for all-day comfort and the control you need for support in all kinds of terrain. They've been engineered so that each step provides the compression necessary to absorb up to four times the body's weight, with a pronounced heel cup keeping the foot centered for greater stability.</p></li><li class="desc-sub-title ">Material &amp; Care</li><li class="desc-sub-text "><p>Mesh, synthetic<br/>Hand wash in cold water, gentle detergent and air dry<br/>Click <a href="http://www.myntra.com/synthetic-care">here</a> for the perfect care products for synthetic shoes</p></li></ul>,25:02:2014,None
